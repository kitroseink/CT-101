    <h3> Description: </h3>

    <p>	In this exercise, I first compiled a selection of images using my title words as prompts to search Unsplash. Then, after importing all the images into AdobePhotoshop (2025), I used an artboard to allow me to view them all without having them directly on the canvas. From there, it was an interative process of adding in an image by moving it into the canvas and seeing how Photoshop would crop or change it. I used layer modes and selection tools to allow aspects of each image to be viewed visually in the final piece, but also played around a lot with layering and cutting out specific areas. I decided to use Unsplash to find photos as it is a platform that allows photographers to share work able to be used both commercially and non-commercially, so it is less likely to have AI-generated work or mis-attributed than just Google Images. I also purposefully choose one-word prompts to see how the search algorithm would influence my image selection, and as a byproduct, my final collage. For example, I thought it was quite interesting that a religious sculpture came up when I searched "death" as one of my prompts, showing how we might associate certain kinds of art with even broader ideas and encode them with those values.</p>
