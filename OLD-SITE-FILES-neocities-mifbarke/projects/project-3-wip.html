    <h3> WIP Description: </h3>

    <p>	Using the game engine, Bitsy, I created an interactive, retro-style short RPG game where you can explore three main rooms to meet NPCs, collect items and try to find the ending. The player meets three main NPCs throughout their journey who speak in a cryptic, code-inspired language and direct the player to think about the purpose of each item they collect. The current implementation is much more limited in playtime, but I hope to use varriables and logic to make the game more immersive. The second part of my final project as well is the development of this website! Using the NeoCities Web Editor, I have created a website to host each project and soon all the exercises I created in this course. I will also be adding a blog style page with my discussion post responses. In working with the NeoCities Editor, I felt as though I not only was able to create a portfolio site, but also weave together the ways in which all my projects were interconnected. While right now this site has very basic CSS and HTML, I also hope to update it with further styling and functionality such as page navigation for the final submission.</p>
