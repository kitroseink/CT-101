    <h3> Final Reflection: </h3>

    <p> This project represents an audio-visual interpretation of the project prompt "The Stories You Tell, the Narratives You Weave" in a retro-inspired, bite-size game made through the Bitsy engine. I was inspired by the words utilized within the prompt title to create the names, dialogue and plot of the project. In the game, You journey as the player character through a mysterious cavern and encounter three main rooms filled with NPCs to interact with and items to collect. Will your thread get cut, or will you be able to collect the materials you need to weave your own story? In essence, this project is an expression of my early inspirations of the retro-games I'd play on the Nintendo64 console growing up. However, I also wanted to envision what a bite-size game project meant to me and how I could interpret the prompt literally by having the player's objective be to weave their own story. I choose Bitsy as I wanted to continue to work in open-source, retro inspired editors, as I had in Decker previously, that allowed me to just experiment freely. While much of the project is still pretty bare-bones, this work and this course as a whole, has been a very cathartic experience for me in reviving my relationship with digital artmaking through smaller-scale, experimental works. Moreover, as I updated my NeoCities site once more to have the final version of this project published, I reflected on how in a way, by writing a few lines of HTML and going through file organization and exportation, I too was weaving my own narrative in this site project as a whole. While I hope to further update this site, and the projects I worked on going forward, I think for me, this course taught me to create inquisitively and to really deeply investigate the ways in which technology can be a tool for digital artists and how the networks that facilitate it can guide the expression and interaction of the new media projects created.</p>

    <!--<h3> WIP Description: </h3>-->

    <!--<p>	Using the game engine, Bitsy, I created an interactive, retro-style short RPG game where you can explore three main rooms to meet NPCs, collect items and try to find the ending. The player meets three main NPCs throughout their journey who speak in a cryptic, code-inspired language and direct the player to think about the purpose of each item they collect. The current implementation is much more limited in playtime, but I hope to use varriables and logic to make the game more immersive. The second part of my final project as well is the development of this website! Using the NeoCities Web Editor, I have created a website to host each project and soon all the exercises I created in this course. I will also be adding a blog style page with my discussion post responses. In working with the NeoCities Editor, I felt as though I not only was able to create a portfolio site, but also weave together the ways in which all my projects were interconnected. While right now this site has very basic CSS and HTML, I also hope to update it with further styling and functionality such as page navigation for the final submission.</p>-->
