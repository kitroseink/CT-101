# Assignment Info: 
- For this week's assignment, you will produce a profile of another _**persona/archetype**_
	- Again, please continue to use the research lab book.

**Your profile ought to include the following:**
- This time, you will imagine your place in a mixed-reality world (whether a gaming platform, virtual reality, augmented reality, etc.) 
	- and how you might defend your right to live within your chosen physical and/or virtual world(s)
- Develop and present an agenda of resistance against the use of bodies in worlds made to sell, convince, or persuade
- Build a simple flowchart describing how you might practice **algorithmic withdrawal, refusal, or obfuscation**
# Brainstorming: 
- persona of a player 
	- within TTRPGs specifically 
		- and visual novels?
	- user research type approach 
	- talk about how zine TTRPGs resist 
		- capitalist practices of labor exploitation/over-consumption (by being more accessible, environmentally friendly and community/crowdfunded)
		- upending traditional (and/or problematic) dynamics in the space
			- dungeon “master” having full control of the worldbuilding + story creation process –> push towards more collaborative storytelling with players having equal control of the narrative
- mixed reality world of TTRPGs
	- online session tools ? (i.e Roll 20, DND Beyond)
		- character creators
		- simulated dice
	- games like baldurs gate (i.e Baldurs Gate 3) & disco elysium?
		- bringing player-driven narratives to the video game space
		- demonstrating ideas of autonomy & power imbalances through TTRPG style storytelling
			- character rolls or makes checks for their actions
			- narrator as a role in the game / story 
			- different stats, effects & party system
	- top down perspective
		- combining AR/VR tech with game pieces & boards?
			- research this for later
		- 3D printing in TTRPG spaces
- algorithmic withdrawal? obfuscation?
	- how can the ruleset change problematic practices? 
		- visually represent how the player would play the TTRPG
			- i.e develop the ruleset & gameplay loop (representing the algorithm of play)
				- maybe reference a ruleset contrary to the goals of the games as an example of algorithmic withdrawal
					- JOD as the DM
						- gideon, harrow & nona (& alecto) as player characters resisting his narrative
							- protagonists —> player characters
	- who dictates the narrative? and can this role be shared equally among players?
	- what about the idea of story routes in player choice & autonomy?
	- how do TTRPG players interact with digital and physical technologies to realize their imagined game worlds? 
		- since TTRPGs take place in the imagination of writing & are brought to life through oral + visual presentation 
		- TTRPGs as a tool/practice for collaborative workshopping stories 
			- community practice– brings players & creatives together
				- social bonding 
				- development of writing & collaboration skills 
					- as well as auxiliary skills related to the “game” such as visual art (building game sets & character models, drawing characters etc.)
				- intersection with activism
					- Jennifer Estralis eco-punk TTRPG
					- queer TTRPGs like “Thirsty Sword Lesbians”
