# Assignment Info
For your **Depth Study**, please continue to use the research lab book you created in the first couple weeks of the quarter. 

**Your Depth Study ought to include the following:**

- Choose two artists and compare their works and their relationship to society and culture. Are there commodities in socially focused work between their chosen media and platforms?
- Identify relationships between artists working in physical and digital media
- Present your study using digital tools or platforms. _Constraint: Do not produce a slide show._ 
    - Consider the following:
        - Digital collage with text
        - Short film (1-3 mins)
        - Social media post
        - Audio recording (3-5 mins)
        - Interactive game (i.e., [Twine](https://twinery.org/), etc.)
        - A one-page site (i.e., [Carrd](https://carrd.co/build), etc.)
- Write a 300-500 word reflection on your findings. Include the following: 
    - Name the two artists you selected
    - Explain your selection process
        - Did you select them because they are contemporaries?
        - Or, did you pick them because an elder artist influenced a younger artist?
        - How do their practices differ? How are they the same?
